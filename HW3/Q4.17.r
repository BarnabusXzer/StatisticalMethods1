# Question 4.17

yellow <- 0.15
red <- 0.10
orange <- 0.20
blue <- 0.25
green <- 0.15
brown <- 0.15

# Part a)
# THE PROBABILITY OF A RANDOMLY SELECTED M&M IS BROWN IS 15%
chance_brown <- brown * 100
print(chance_brown)

# Part b)
# THE PROBABILITY OF A RANDOMLY SELECTED M&M IS RED OR GREEN IS 25%
chance_brown_green <- (brown + green) * 100
print(chance_brown_green)

# Part c)
# THE PROBABILITY OF A RANDOMLY SELECTED M&M IS NOT BLUE IS 75%
chance_not_blue <- (1 - blue) * 100
print(chance_not_blue)

# Part d)
# THE PROBABILITY OF A RANDOMLY SELECTED M&M IS BOTH RED AND BROWN IN 0%
# A SINGLE SAMPLE IN THIS STUDY CANNOT BE TWO COLORS
